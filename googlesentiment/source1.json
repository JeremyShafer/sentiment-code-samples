The project was fantastic in that we had a lot of room to create whatever we wanted to create and test out our coding skills. It was very challenging but very rewarding. I will say I found myself procrastinating work on other classes by working on my app for a couple of weeks because it\nwas such an interesting project and, with the competitive aspect, I wanted my app to be the best. I also like the way that the course is\nstructured with spending 2/3 of the semester learning new tools that we can use on the project which we work on in the final 1/3 of the\nsemester."
